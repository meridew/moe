1) Unified Tenant Configuration Management (UTCM) APIs – Best for Baselines & Comparisons

The UTCM APIs are specifically designed for capturing, storing, and comparing configurations across multiple workloads, including Intune. They are the primary Graph APIs to use when your goal is baseline-centric:

Key Capabilities

Snapshot APIs
Retrieve the current configuration state of tenant resources (including Intune). Use this to capture a baseline snapshot programmatically.

Monitor APIs
Set up configuration monitors to detect drift over time between a stored “desired state” and actual current state.

Drift APIs
List differences (delta) between snapshots and live state — ideal for comparison views.

Configuration Baselines (snapshots collection)
Manage collection of stored baseline snapshots.

What UTCM Provides for Intune

It includes Intune as a supported workload in the configuration management domain, meaning you can snapshot and compare Intune configuration settings along with other Microsoft 365 services.

Versioning Caveat

The UTCM APIs are currently in Microsoft Graph beta and subject to change. They’re the right choice for prototype and preview work; for production, keep an eye on stability and roadmap.

Graph endpoint patterns you’ll use:

GET /beta/configurationManagement/configurationSnapshots – list stored baselines

POST /beta/configurationManagement/configurationSnapshotJobs – create a snapshot

GET /beta/configurationManagement/configurationDrifts – query drift results

GET /beta/configurationManagement/configurationMonitoringResults – check monitor output

2) Intune-Specific Graph APIs – For Fine-Grained Setting Retrieval & Edits

The Intune Graph APIs in Microsoft Graph let you CRUD individual Intune policy objects. Use these when you need direct control over Intune settings outside of snapshots.

Relevant APIs

Configuration Policies

deviceManagementConfigurationPolicy – access policy definitions (per platform).

deviceManagementConfigurationPolicyTemplate – policy template metadata for new baselines.

Security Baseline Templates

securityBaselineTemplate – Intune security baseline definitions you can use as starting points.

Device & App Inventory

Intune devices/apps endpoints let you inspect applied configuration targets.

Typical Use Cases

Display detailed policy definitions in the UI

Enable editing of baseline definitions at the policy level

Create or update Intune policies via UI workflows

These direct Intune APIs do not provide built-in comparison or baseline snapshot/diff features — that’s where UTCM adds value.

3) Combined Architecture Recommendation

To achieve a baseline creation, comparison, and management experience in Intune, combine both API sets:

a) Baseline Snapshot & Comparison Layer

Use UTCM APIs for:

Capturing full-tenant (or workload-scoped) snapshots

Storing baselines in your app

Comparing baselines to current state (delta view)

Monitoring drift over time

This becomes the core comparison engine.

b) Detail Management & Editing UI

Use Intune Graph APIs for:

Presenting individual Intune policy details

Creating/updating policies

Importing policies into a baseline template

This becomes the policy authoring and management layer.

c) UX Workflow Pattern

Snapshot current state: POST configurationSnapshotJobs

Store baseline: Save snapshot metadata & responses in your DB

Edit baseline policies: Use Intune policy APIs

Run comparison: GET configurationDrifts against current snapshot

Display UI: Show drift results next to policy details

4) Authentication & Permissions

To call these APIs, you’ll need:

Graph OAuth tokens with appropriate scopes:

ConfigurationMonitoring.Read.All / ConfigurationMonitoring.ReadWrite.All for UTCM APIs

Intune scopes (DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All, DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All) for policy CRUD

Configure the UTCM service principal if using background automation.

5) API Maturity & Practical Considerations
Capability	Primary API Set	Notes
Capture baseline (tenant config)	UTCM	Beta endpoint, essential for snapshotting
Compare two baselines	UTCM	Built-in diff support
Detect drift over time	UTCM monitors	Supports automated comparison
Edit policy definitions	Intune Graph	Standard Graph resource APIs
Templates for new baseline	Intune Graph	Use security baseline templates
Summary

Best APIs for your app:

Unified Tenant Configuration Management (UTCM) Graph APIs — for snapshot, baseline, and comparison workflows (primary comparison engine).

Intune-specific Graph APIs — for detailed policy data and editing capabilities linked to Intune settings.

Use UTCM to capture and compare configurations, and Intune APIs to manage and update individual settings.
